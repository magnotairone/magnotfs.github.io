title: "Model selection criteria for regression models with splines and the automatic localization of knots"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-06-04-covid
excerpt: 'In this paper we propose a model selection approach to fit a regression model using splines with a variable number of knots. We introduce a penalized criterion to estimate the number and the position of the knots where to anchor the splines basis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and applied to covid-19 daily reported cases for short-term prediction.'

In this paper we propose a model selection approach to fit a regression model using splines with a variable number of knots. We introduce a penalized criterion to estimate the number and the position of the knots where to anchor the splines basis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and applied to covid-19 daily reported cases for short-term prediction.
